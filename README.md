# Piget 
Automated File Retrieval tool 

## Introduction 
Piget is an FTP based automated file retrieval tool. 
It retrieves entire remote directories periodically. 

## Why?
My home surveillance system is a Raspberry Pi having limited memory. 
This is very handy, as it will automatically move the remote directory, 
containing surveillance footage to my workstation.
